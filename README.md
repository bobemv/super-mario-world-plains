# Super Mario World Plains
Exercise to learn Unity fundamentals: replicating the first level of Donut Plains from Super Mario World (the first level where Mario gets the cape). In this exercise I've implemented the gameplay programming.

Things I have learnt/done:

- Being very careful setting in which state is your player for player animation and making a correct flow for animations.
- Using the powerful tools Unity gives you is a good practice, but sometimes they are not exactly what you need and it can bring more harm than good. In this case, for Mario jumping between platforms I used Raycasts (casting them from Mario's feet) and BoxColliders instead of depending entirely on BoxColliders, Physics and Triggers.
- Camera movement is an art. Thanks to Itay Keren for this wonderful article breaking down Camera's systems in several games: https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/ItayKeren/20150511/243083/Scroll_Back_The_Theory_and_Practice_of_Cameras_in_SideScrollers.php
